      'The Workspace maps how things connect: open any folder and Magnify turns it into a living map of how your files, documents, media and configs relate. See what changed, what matters, and what a change would affect — search everything, compare folders, and pin findings into saved investigations.',

      'Metering covers short and integrated LUFS, peak and RMS, a loudness-target guide (Club / Stream / Apple / EBU), and a frequency-coloured spectrum. Key and BPM are estimated automatically when you load a track. Presets — factory and your own — save to disk and import/export as .json, with undo/redo and a recallable master history.',
      'Export masters to WAV (16 / 24 / 32-bit, optional normalise), band stems (SUB / LOW / MID / HIGH), or separate into KICK / DRUMS / BASS / MELODY. Separation uses real HPSS — harmonic/percussive source separation by spectrogram median-filtering — pulling drums apart from melodic, tonal content, then splitting each by frequency.'
